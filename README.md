## Abstract 📝

## Project Goals 🎯

1. Scrape mental health related data from various blog sites like Blurt, Chipur, and Natashatracy.com using Selenium with Dagster Orchestration tool. 🕷️
2. Clean and categorize the scraped data using OpenAIExtractionChain, then store it into a Snowflake database along with associated metadata. 🧹
3. Use dbt to run transformations on the scraped data. 🔧
4. Embed the transformed data using OpenAI embeddings and store it into ChromaDB for efficient similarity search. 🔍
5.

## Use Case 📖

The use case for this project is to develop a mental health platform that leverages conversation AI based on Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to offer users a supportive and non-judgmental space, fostering emotional well-being and personal introspection. 🧠💞
